# Zero-width-Inserter

Some social media platforms scan for "inappropriate" words, and may ban the poster for having those words in the post, 
even though the poster has no bad intentions. 
        
By inserting zero-width characters between words, this tool can prevent those "inappropriate" words from being detected.

This tool is not intended for unethical purposes.
